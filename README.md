## 📘 What’s Covered So Far

This playlist currently includes:

- **Core Concepts**  
  - Agent, environment, state, action, reward  
  - Episodic vs continuing tasks  
  - Exploration vs exploitation

- **Fundamental Algorithms**  
  - Value functions and Bellman equations  
  - Policy evaluation and improvement  
  - Introduction to Dynamic Programming

- **Hands-On Notebooks**  
  - Annotated walkthroughs in Python  
  - Simple gridworld examples using NumPy  
  - Output-verified exercises for reproducibility

- **Teachable Explanations**  
  - Every term is defined  
  - Each step is annotated  
  - Designed to be understandable and shareable
